## 💾 Database

All data is stored locally in the browser using IndexedDB (via Dexie.js). No data is ever sent to any server.

### Tables

| Table | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `categories` | Product categories (name, color, icon) |
| `products` | Master products (name, SKU, sell price, COGS, stock, unit) |
| `suppliers` | Supplier data |
| `stockIns` | Stock-in records |
| `stockOuts` | Stock-out records |
| `hppHistory` | COGS change audit trail |
| `paymentMethods` | Payment methods (Cash, Bank Transfer, QRIS, etc.) |
| `transactions` | Sales transactions (status: open/completed, customer name, table number, remarks) |
| `transactionItems` | Individual items within each transaction (with per-item notes) |
| `storeSettings` | Store settings & app state |

### COGS Calculation (Weighted Average)

When stock is received, COGS is automatically recalculated:

```
New COGS = ((Old Stock × Old COGS) + (New Qty × Buy Price)) / (Old Stock + New Qty)
```
